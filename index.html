                    Early in the morning of June 17, 1972, sev&shy;eral burglars were arrested in&shy;side
                    the office of the Demo&shy;crat&shy;ic National Committee (DNC), located in the
                    Wa&shy;tergate building in Wash&shy;ington, D.C. This was no or&shy;dinary rob&shy;bery:
                    The prowlers were connected to Pres&shy;ident Richard Nixon’s re&shy;election campaign,
                    and they had been caught while at&shy;tempting to wiretap phones and steal secret
                    doc&shy;u&shy;ments. While histo&shy;rians are not sure whether Nixon knew about the
                    <h3>Wa&shy;tergate espionage op&shy;eration before</h3> it hap&shy;pened, he took steps
                    to cover it up af&shy;terwards, rais&shy;ing “hush mon&shy;ey” for the burglars, trying
                    to stop the Fed&shy;eral Bu&shy;reau of Inves&shy;tigation (FBI) from
                    inves&shy;tigating the crime, de&shy;stroying ev&shy;idence and firing
                    unco&shy;op&shy;erative staff members. In Au&shy; gust 1974, af&shy;ter his role in
                    the Wa&shy;tergate con&shy;spir&shy;acy had finally come to light, the pres&shy;ident
                    resigned. His successor, Gerald Ford, im&shy;me&shy;diately pardoned Nixon for all the
                    crimes he “committed or may have committed” while in office. Al&shy;though Nixon was
                    nev&shy;er pros&shy;ecuted, the Wa&shy;tergate scan&shy;dal changed American politics
                    for&shy;ev&shy;er, leading many Americans to question their leader&shy;ship and think
                    more crit&shy;ically about the pres&shy;idency.
