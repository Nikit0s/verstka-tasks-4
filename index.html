                        Early in the morning of June 17, 1972, sev&shy;eral burglars were arrested in&shy;
                        side the office of the Demo&shy;crat&shy;ic National Committee (DNC), located in the
                        Wa&shy;tergate building in Wash&shy;ington, D.C. This was no or&shy;dinary
                        rob&shy;bery: The prowlers were connected to Pres&shy;ident Richard Nixon’s
                        re&shy;election campaign, and they had been caught while at&shy;tempting to wiretap
                        phones and steal secret doc&shy;u&shy;ments. While histo&shy;rians are not sure
                        whether Nixon knew about the <h3>Wa&shy;tergate espionage op&shy;eration before</h3>
                        it hap&shy;pened, he took steps to cover it up af&shy;terwards, rais&shy;ing “hush
                        mon&shy;ey” for the burglars, trying to stop the Fed&shy;eral Bu&shy;reau of
                        Inves&shy;tigation (FBI) from inves&shy;tigating the crime, de&shy;stroying
                        ev&shy;idence and firing unco&shy;op&shy;erative staff members. In Au&shy; gust
                        1974, af&shy;ter his role in the Wa&shy;tergate con&shy;spir&shy;acy had finally
                        come to light, the pres&shy;ident resigned. His successor, Gerald Ford,
                        im&shy;me&shy;diately pardoned Nixon for all the crimes he “committed or may have
                        committed” while in office. Al&shy;though Nixon was nev&shy;er pros&shy;ecuted, the
                        Wa&shy;tergate scan&shy;dal changed American politics for&shy;ev&shy;er, leading
                        many Americans to question their leader&shy;ship and think more crit&shy;ically
                        about the pres&shy;idency.
